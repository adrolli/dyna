# Dyna Starter Theme

The dyna Starter-Theme is based on Underscores and the Gutenberg Starter Theme. It is currently under hard development and will soon add some interesting features. You may use it, fork it and do something cool with it.

## Demo Website

There is no Demo set up for now. Visit our official Website on https://dyna.press to see how Dyna looks. Note that this is just a starter theme, stunning design things will be added soon.

## Installation

Installation is very easy. You need a WordPress, download the ZIP-file from Github and install the Theme from your WordPress Admin. There will be other ways and better instructions coming soon.

## Translation

Dyna is available in major languages and complete translation-ready. See the translation status and help translating Dyna on https://poeditor.com/join/project/t3gmD1eDOu
